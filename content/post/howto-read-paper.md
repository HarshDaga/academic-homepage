We read a lot of papers. I thought it would be beneficial if I document how I organize the summary. 
Sometimes, I am in a hurry and read a lot of papers before summarizing them. 
This results sometimes in anxiety and even worse what you learned will be easily lost. 
By following standarized procedure for reading papers, I hope I can overcome this. 

### My procedure 

- After you read the paper, move it to google drive. 
- If you have annotation with pen and highlighting marker, replicate it on the file. 
- Add the reference to [the reference mindmap](https://www.mindmeister.com/1405726945/references). I embedded the mindmap in the post. 
- If there is an interesting pictures, save photos to the google drive Paper figures folders and attach it into the mindmap
- Start summarizing the paper in the mindmap. A few place holders will be following. 
  - **Summary** What is this paper about? 
  - **Good** What are good points?
  - **Bad** What are my criticism? 
  - **Implication** How I can use this work? What will be different from my approach? 
- After summarizing them, add those summary in the homepage review post. Here is [an example post](http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/post/mapping-the-landscape-of-human-level-agi.md/). 
- Finally, if the paper is worth sharing, add the paper to HDILab journal with the link to the summary post such that it can be shared. 

Below is my mindmap for the related papers to artificial general intelligence.
